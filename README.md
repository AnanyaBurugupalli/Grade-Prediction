# Grade-Prediction

This project predicts student grades based on academic, personal, and behavioral features using various regression models.

## 📌 Objective

To build and evaluate machine learning models that can predict a student's final grade based on input features such as study time, previous scores, absences, and more.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used contains student information such as:
- Study time
- Failures
- Absences
- Grades in previous exams (G1, G2)
- Demographic attributes

## 🧪 Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature encoding
   - Scaling features

2. **Modeling**
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Tree Regressor
   - Random Forest Regressor

3. **Evaluation**
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
   - R² Score

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📈 Results

The models were evaluated on test data, and performance metrics were recorded to compare accuracy and robustness.
